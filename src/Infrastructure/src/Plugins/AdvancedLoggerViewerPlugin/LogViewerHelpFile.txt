General remarks
===

This view allows to browse log content in *offline* mode. It means that once refreshed, new entries are not appended to result view. In order to search new
entires another refresh should be invoked.
To refresh the view context use button *Refresh* located in upper-right corner. This process may take a while, especially on heavy-log emulation.

Result window
===

By default the view displays at most 10 last log entries of level *Info* or higher.
There is a combo-box in the upper-left corner that allows to change the amount of log entries displayed at once in the view.
In order to filter log entries based on their log levels use buttons located in bottom-left corner.

Advanced filtering of entries
---

To use advanced filtering enter query text and use button *Query* located in bottom-right corner. Example queries: 

**`register`**

filters entires that contains word *register* in *Text* column

**`register RegA`** or **`register OR RegA`**

filters entries that contains words *register* or *RegA* in *Text* column

**`"register RegA"`** 

filter entries that contains the exact phrase *register RegA* in *Text* column

**`register AND RegA`**

filters entries that contains words *register* and *RegA* (not necessarily in this order or next to each other) in *Text* column

**`source\:Monitor`**

filters entries that contains word *Monitor* in *Source* column

Queries can contain special wildcard characters: `?` or `\*` which matches single or multiple characters accordingly.
